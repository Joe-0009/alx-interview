# Min Operations

## Description
The `min_operations` function calculates the minimum number of operations required to generate exactly `n` H characters using a sequence of "Copy All" and "Paste" operations. The function takes an integer `n` and returns the minimum number of operations needed.

## Methodology
The approach is to use factorization to determine the number of operations. Each factor of `n` represents a "Copy All" followed by a series of "Paste" operations. The sum of these factors gives the minimum number of operations.

### Steps:
1. **Check Base Case**:
   - If `n` is less than 2, return 0 as no operations are needed.

2. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `operations` to keep track of the total number of operations.
   - `divisor` starting at 2 to find the smallest factor of `n`.

3. **Factorization Loop**:
   - Iterate from `divisor` = 2 up to `n`.
   - If `n` is divisible by `divisor`, add `divisor` to `operations` and divide `n` by `divisor`.
   - Decrease `divisor` by 1 to handle multiple factors of the same value.
   - Increment `divisor` to check the next possible factor.

4. **Return Operations**:
   - The sum of all factors represents the minimum number of operations.

## Usage
```python
>>> min_operations(9)
6
>>> min_operations(15)
8
