# N-Queens Solver

This is a Python script that solves the N-Queens problem. The N-Queens problem is a classic combinatorial problem where the goal is to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

## Usage

The script requires one command-line argument, `N`, which specifies the size of the chessboard (NxN) and the number of queens to place.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Running the Script

To run the script, use the following command in your terminal:

```sh
./nqueens.py N
